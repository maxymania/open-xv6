This is a Hobby OS targeting AMD64 derived from xv6

Specifically the the AMD64 port of xv6 found here: https://github.com/swetland/xv6

I am not attempting to be as minimally intrusive as possible. Instead i try to make
xv6 better somehow.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The original upstream branch (mirror) was pulled from the git repository
git://pdos.csail.mit.edu/xv6/xv6.git

The original project homepage is here:
http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2012/xv6.html

The PDF books about the rev7 version of xv6 are checked into the books branch
of this repository for easy access.  They come from the xv6 project's home site.

The original README remains as README.orig -- renamed to avoid misrepresenting
this working branch and any local changes as the original project and to 
hopefully avoid people pestering the original authors about bugs I may introduce
while poking at their code.

--------------------------

README.64BIT contains notes about the 64bit port.

Code organisation

swetland (https://github.com/swetland):

The code has been organized into kernel/, include/, user/, ulib/, and tools/
subdirectories, and arranged so that the build puts intermediate object files
into kobj/ and uobj/ directories, other intermediates into out/, and the
filesystem contents into fs/.

The Makefile defaults to building the 32bit version of xv6.  Define the X64
environment variable to build the 64bit version.


Me:

How the code within include/ has been organized:
include/defs.h -> include/krnl/kdefs.h
include/krnl/kdefs.h -> include/krnl/acpi.h, include/krnl/bio.h, ........
include/types.h -> include/gnrc/types.h
include/acpi.h -> include/gnrc/acpi.h
more stuff to be moved!
